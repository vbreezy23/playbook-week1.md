the role of computer hardware and operating systems in IT support.
imagine computer hardware and operating systems as the body and brain of a robot that IT support guys have to take care of. Computer hardware is all the physical stuff you can 
touch, like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and the computer's insides like the motherboard and hard drive. If the hardware breaks down, like a key falling off the keyboard or
  the computer not turning on, the IT support team needs to figure out what's broken and either fix it or replace it. The operating system (OS) is like the brain that tells 
the hardware what to do. Windows, macOS, and Linux are examples of operating systems. The OS makes sure all the different parts of the computer work together. When something
goes wrong with the OS, like programs crashing or the computer freezing, IT support has to troubleshoot and fix it. They might need to reinstall the OS, update drivers, or get 
rid of viruses. Basically, IT support needs to know a lot about both hardware and operating systems to keep everything running smoothly. If the body (hardware) or brain (OS) 
isn't working right, they're the ones who have to fix it!
