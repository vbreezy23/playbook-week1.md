Role of netwroks in daily life
networks are everywhere, and we use them all the time without even realizing it.
when you're on your phone, scrolling through TikTok or playing games, that's all thanks to networks. They're what connect you to the internet and let you do all that stuff. And when you're at school, using the computers to do research or work on projects, you're using a network too. It's how everyone shares files and gets online.
networks are what make the world go 'round these days. They let us talk to our friends, watch funny videos, and do our homework. Without them, life would be, like, totally different and way less fun!
